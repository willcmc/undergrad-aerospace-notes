# Classical Controls
My notes, codes, links, material... and whatnot! from the duration of my study of Classical Control Systems at the Indian Institute of Technology Kharagpur, enrolled in the B.Tech Aerospace Engineering program. It all started at a harmless robotics camp... Been a rough ride at times, but I will always ❤️ control system engineering.
